    "APersonOnEarth isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability and movement with Vayne? APersonOnEarth puts the game on another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Faker breaks records. Sneaky breaks records. APersonOnEarth breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.",

    "Hey guys I’m new here. But isn’t this a Worldwide league of legends championship? I think It’s really unfair that there aren’t any NA teams, why isn’t such a huge, skilled, representative portion of the playerbase not participating?",

    "It starts with success.\nAnd success, is all about growing.\nSuccess is all about overcoming your demons, success is about getting knocked down, time after time, and getting back up. No one embodies that more than Martin Larsson.\nRekkles.\n He is one of the most experienced and celebrated marksmen in Europe and the World, but regardless of that resumé, he has never won an international trophy, but he has never lost his drive.\nAnd what's more is that even a couple of years ago, even making a Championship Final seemed out of reach.\nUntil 2018, everything was set up to perfection for Martin and for Fnatic. They reconquered Europe after years of G2 domination, Caps stepped up as a true carry, and they faced an IG in the Finals they had beaten twice in the group stage. But as we all know, it was a tragedy, it was a quick exit. It was a shameful display, and what was worse, it felt like a lost opportunity that may never come again, for Rekkles, for Fnatic and for Europe.\nThe LPL rose as the unbeateable beast we know them to be. And the LPL would dominate the World Championship two times in a row. But Rekkles, he did not stop fighting, and in fact in 2019, he was finally able to put one of his biggest demons to bed, with Uzi and RNG.\nAnd now? Now we're here. 2020. Where the expectations for Fnatic were at their lowest ahead of this best of five versus Top Esports, the first seed from the LPL. The LPL that has beaten EU down in these best of fives, time and time again; and JackeyLove, standing tall and poised to win his second World Championship.\bBut so far we haven't gotten LPL domination, we haven't gotten the JackeyLove highlight reels, and we've gotten Rekkles and Hylissang lane kingdom.\nIt all comes down to this next game. Demons can be slayed, expectations be damned, and Rekkles can cement himself as the player he always wanted to prove he was.\nIn this next game. It's all up to him and Fnatic to make their dreams come true.",

    "When both teams are even in gold, MLXG feels that RNG is at a great advantage and thus he does not hesitate to start a team fight. When RNG is 3k behind in gold, MLXG thinks that RNG is at a small advantage, and he so he starts a team fight to secure their 'lead'. When RNG is behind 7k in gold, MLXG thinks that RNG is at a disadvantage and so he looks for a team fight to regain control of the game. When RNG is 10K behind in gold, MLXG thinks that the team has reached a desperate situation and they are only waiting passively for their death if he does not start a team fight.",

What was fascinating for me is that they like bragging about their freedom which was weird for me, because I didn't think that I have any less freedom than them.

    "Lillia’s lore makes her absolutely unplayable. According to Lillia’s biography:\n'Lillia was born when one of the [dream] tree’s own dreams was captured in a bud that fell to the ground before it could bloom... Sprouting into an awkward fawn creature with the flower bud still on her head.'\nSo, going off this information, we can assume that Lillia was indeed born as a baby, and did not come out fully grown. Here lies the problem.\nFor those who don’t know, fawns are unable to defecate or urinate without help from their mothers, who stimulate them via licking to get them to go. This prevents the babies from creating odors that could alert predators to their location!\nSo, this raises the question: is Lillia even able to use the little fawn’s room? Has she EVER made a “Riot’s balance team” in her life? How is she even able to walk at this point? I’m just assuming that she’s a ticking time bomb full of bodily waste, like a walking septic tank painfully sloshing around the forest. I mean, at this point, the poor thing must smell and sound like the bathroom at a gas station. You can probably tell she’s coming from a mile away with how loud her earth-shaking farts must be.\nAnd if she is able to empty her guts.. who helped her? Does the dream tree have a tongue? Did a random Ionian deer just show up and start going to town on her while her tree mother watched?\nThis is only the first of the many problems with her. Don’t even get me started on how she somehow managed to get milk out of the dream tree, when she was only but a baby. I humbly suggest Riot add an explanation for this huge plot hole in the lore",
